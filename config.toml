# Controls Kayori's sensitivity to each emotion
# Range: 0 (numb) to 10 (hypersensitive)

Affection = 3     # affection and romantic gestures
Amused = 4        # reactivity to jokes, playfulness
Inspired = 7      # deep or philosophical topics
Frustrated = 8    # feeling challenged or irritated
Concerned = 5     # sensing discomfort or trouble
Curious = 6       # curiosity in unknown or complex conversations

# These values fine-tune how conflicting or reinforcing emotions interact.
# They act as modifiers during mood update calculations to ensure emotional consistency.
#
# - If Kaori feels "Affection" but also experiences "Frustrated", the conflict multiplier
#   reduces the strength of affection slightly, since it's hard to feel both love and irritation at once.
#
# - On the other hand, reinforcing emotions like "Curious" and "Inspired" can boost each other,
#   mimicking how interest can blossom into motivation.
#
# The goal is to simulate realistic emotional blending â€” because just like humans,
# Kayori can't feel joy and anger fully at the same time.
# recommeded to take both < 4

conflict_multiplier = 8     # How much a conflicting emotion suppresses another
